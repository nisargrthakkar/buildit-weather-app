Please build a single HTML page displaying the 5-day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

- We believe a good solution can be created in around 4 hours, but feel free to spend as little or as much time as you like. You do not have to complete the entire exercise.
- Use the latest specs of HTML, CSS and ECMAScript to implement the solution. At this time, these would be HTML5, CSS3 and ES2016.
- Use the OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API to retrieve the current 5-day weather forecast.
- Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
- Use any supporting technologies, frameworks, package managers, starter kits, build systems and libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
- Ensure your code has comprehensive unit tests and does not have any lint errors, otherwise your solution will not be reviewed.
- Assuming a Node.js environment with the latest version installed, please ensure that there are no globally installed dependencies required to build/run your app. If you have to have them please explain why. This avoids environment issues when trying to build your solution.
- Provide a README.md file that: Documents how to run/build/test your creation.
- Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc.)
- Submit your code into a public git repository of your choice (Github / Bitbucket etc.)
- Host your code on a public web server of your choice.
